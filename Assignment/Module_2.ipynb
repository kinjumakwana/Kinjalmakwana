It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.\n","\n","or\n","\n","Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.\n","\n","<b>Python Features</b>\n","\n","Python provides many useful features which make it popular and valuable from the other programming languages. It supports object-oriented programming, procedural programming approaches and provides dynamic memory allocation. We have listed below a few essential features.\n","\n","1) Easy to Learn and Use\n","Python is easy to learn as compared to other programming languages. Its syntax is straightforward and much the same as the English language. There is no use of the semicolon or curly-bracket, the indentation defines the code block. It is the recommended programming language for beginners.\n","\n","2) Expressive Language\n","Python can perform complex tasks using a few lines of code. A simple example, the hello world program you simply type print(\"Hello World\"). It will take only one line to execute, while Java or C takes multiple lines.\n","\n","3) Interpreted Language\n","Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program is executed one line at a time. The advantage of being interpreted language, it makes debugging easy and portable.\n","\n","4) Cross-platform Language\n","Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh, etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language. It enables programmers to develop the software for several competing platforms by writing a program only once.\n","\n","5) Free and Open Source\n","Python is freely available for everyone. It is freely available on its official website www.python.org\n",". It has a large community across the world that is dedicatedly working towards make new python modules and functions. Anyone can contribute to the Python community. The open-source means, \"Anyone can download its source code without paying any penny.\"\n","\n","6) Object-Oriented Language\n","Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence. It supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc. The object-oriented procedure helps to programmer to write reusable code and develop applications in less code.\n","\n","7) Extensible\n","It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can be used further in our Python code. It converts the program into byte code, and any platform can use that byte code.\n","\n","8) Large Standard Library\n","It provides a vast range of libraries for the various fields such as machine learning, web developer, and also for the scripting. There are various machine learning libraries, such as Tensor flow, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, and Pytorch, etc. Django, flask, pyramids are the popular framework for Python web development.\n","\n","9) GUI Programming Support\n","Graphical User Interface is used for the developing Desktop application. PyQT5, Tkinter, Kivy are the libraries which are used for developing the web application.\n","\n","10) Integrated\n","It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, and JAVA, etc. Python runs code line by line like C,C++ Java. It makes easy to debug the code.\n","\n","11)Embeddable\n","The code of the other programming language can use in the Python source code. We can use Python source code in another programming language as well. It can embed other language into our code.\n","\n","12) Dynamic Memory Allocation\n","In Python, we don't need to specify the data-type of the variable. When we assign some value to the variable, it automatically allocates the memory to the variable at run time. Suppose we are assigned integer value 15 to x, then we don't need to write int x = 15. Just write x = 15.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hW9CEHklFA_b"},"source":["# B2:Write a Python program to get the Python version you are using?"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":23,"status":"ok","timestamp":1649654750224,"user":{"displayName":"Kinjal Makwana","userId":"04673257889097412257"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"OeMb10CxFXLO","outputId":"01f4b8a0-8581-4c90-b08a-78dd9b47b188"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Python version\n","3.7.13 (default, Mar 16 2022, 17:37:17) \n","[GCC 7.5.0]\n","Version info.\n","sys.version_info(major=3, minor=7, micro=13, releaselevel='final', serial=0)\n"]}],"source":["import sys\n","print(\"Python version\")\n","print (sys.version)\n","print(\"Version info.\")\n","print (sys.version_info)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":489,"status":"ok","timestamp":1649654880433,"user":{"displayName":"Kinjal Makwana","userId":"04673257889097412257"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"YVHYbuL9F8m3","outputId":"c59d1b1f-9925-4cd7-cb46-7b633ce84067"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["3.7.13\n"]}],"source":["import platform\n","print(platform.python_version())"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uGxb230bGSXi"},"source":["command line \n","python -V\n","\n","or \n","\n","python ––version\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BuJz1Z7eECKS"},"source":["B3.Is python the right choice for Web based Programming?\n","\n","Of course,\n","Python is the one of the right choice of developing web\n","application bcoz using python we can develop the rapid\n","development of the application for which other languages\n","requires more time.\n","\n","Their are many MVC frameworks are available through which we\n","can develop web application in less time and writting less code.\n","\n","Popular Frameworks are : Django, Zope, CherryPy, TurboGears etc."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2_lC_5XlGJVZ"},"source":["B4.Why was the language called as Python?\n","\n","When he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was also reading the published scripts from “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s.

This byte code translation is performed to speed execution byte code can be run much quicker than the original source code statements.\n","\n","The .pyc file , created in compilation step, is then executed by appropriate virtual machines. The Virtual Machine just a big loop that iterates through your byte code instructions, one by one, to carry out their operations.

and complexity of the bug.\n","PyChecker is a tool for finding bugs in python source code. It finds problems that are typically caught by a compiler for less dynamic languages, like C and C++. Because of the dynamic nature of python , some warnings may be incorrect; however, spurious warnings should be fairly infrequent. PyChecker works in a combination of ways. First, it imports each module. If there is an import error , the module cannot be processed. The import provides some basic information about the module. The code for each function, class, and method is checked for possible problems.\n","\n","How to use PyChecker?\n","You can use it directly in your code. All you have to do is import PyChecker at the top of your module, like this:\n"," \n","import pychecker.checker\n","\n","This will make PyChecker check all the following imported modules, although it won’t do the main module.\n","\n","Commandline\n","To use PyChecker , pass options and the python source files (or packages) you want to check on the command line:\n"," \n","pychecker [options] file1.py file2.py ...\n","\n","- Pychecker can be simply installed by using pip package pip install Pychecker if suppose if you use python 3.6 version use upgrade pip install Pychecker --upgrade Pylint can be simply installed by using pip package \n","\n","Pylint\n","- Pylint is highly configurable and it acts like special programs to control warnings and errors, it is an extensive configuration file Pylint is also an opensource tool for static code analysis it looks for programming errors and is used for coding standard. it checks the length of each programming line. it checks the variable names according to the project style. it can also be used as a standalone program, it also integrates with python IDEs such as Pycharm, Spyder, Eclipse, and Jupyter\n","\n","Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce a coding standard and looks for code smells. It can also look for certain type errors, it can recommend suggestions about how particular blocks can be refactored and can offer you details about the code's complexity. It is a useful tool to improve code quality and to ensure that it complies with PEP-8 style guidelines. Pylint will display a number of messages as it analyzes the code and it can also be used for displaying some statistics about the number of warnings and errors found in different files.

But sometimes, we need to read the code again and again.\n","\n","At this point, we must have an idea of why we wrote the particular line in the code. The code should reflect the meaning of each line.
